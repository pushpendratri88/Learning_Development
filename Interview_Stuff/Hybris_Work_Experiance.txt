###Challenges ###
Backoffice customization :-
    - Created text editor where it gives the flexibility to format the text 
    - Disabling the fields on the basis of condition by using dynamic forms 
    - 4 lakhs of data to be write in CSV File which hangs the system .
      worked on performance. fetch all the data at once and while writting it      into CSV . split the data in bunch of 100 and look over it to write 100 data first.
    - Drastically Reduce the data and cronjob execution time. Removed not nessasary data which is huge and writen a logice to avoide the data whose combination will be unused . redused from 15 Lakh of record to 2 lakh of valid record . and cronjob time redused from 1 hour to 20 min 

Big Implementation:
1. Favourite Product :-  Make use of wishlist OOB functionality where PLP page is divided into 2 section (favourite and non favourite products). single hit to  solr server to fetch the product. Dividing section and maintain the order from UI.
